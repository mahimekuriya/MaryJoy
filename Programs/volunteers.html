      <h4>MJDA has adopted the following definition for Volunteerism</h4>
      <p style="line-height: 2;">
        <li>Volunteerism, in its conceptual form, includes the individual or collective efforts of willing individuals, known as volunteers, to act in ways which
         work toward the betterment of other individuals, communities, and/or society</li>

      <li> Volunteerism is not about giving away something for nothing – it’s about mutual growth through providing assistance and help to other people;</li><br>
      <li>Volunteer service is offered by choice - it is not mandated or coerced. It contributes to the well-being of an individual or the community, and is usually
        coordinated by a nonprofit or public sector organization, and pays no salary or wages;</li><br>
      <li>Volunteering is the most fundamental act of citizenship and philanthropy in our society. It is offering time, energy and skills of one's own free will.</li>
<br>
    Accordingly to the aforementioned definition, MJDA counts with hundreds of volunteers as celebrities from the sport, media, entertainment, culture and fashion
     sector, community volunteers from Idders, School Clubs and Community Associations, specialist professionals, consultants and internship students among others.

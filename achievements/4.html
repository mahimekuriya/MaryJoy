<h1 style="margin-top:30px;color:#001A4D"><b>“Thanks to my new job, today my life has changed radically”</b></h1>

<p>Kafile Asrat, 23 years old.
Debrezague, Oromia, Ethiopia

His mind has erased all living memory of his parents. People say that they died when he was a baby. The truth is when he was just 6 months old he was separated from his mom, because everybody in the family believed that she was suffering from a transmittable disease.

This is why Kafile ended up just living in the “neighborhood”.

Of his childhood, Kafile remembers the sad and hard times mostly characterized by abuse: physical aggression and all the nights without eating.

This situation led Kafile to run away from home. He fled to Fiche, a small town located in the Oromia region. As soon as he arrived, yet another difficult stage began in Kafile’s life.

Living conditions went from difficult to complete abandonment and hunger. He was homeless living in the courtyard of a house with just one blanket suffering at the hands of child exploitation. He worked as a shipper, earning around 0.50 birr (8 cents) per day.
TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN TODAY

Kafile doesn’t remember how long he was exploited, but thinks even one day is too long. In 2008, he left Fiche for Addis Ababa to find better opportunities and hopefully a better life. One day, he met the Ray Asssociation through a friend. Ray Association is a group of youths located in Yeka sub city, on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. The Ray Association specializes in milk, eggs and vegetable production. Ray Association has partnered with Mary Joy since 2007 and has 12 members. Ray Association supports its members with income generating activities training, book keeping, and other life skills.

Kafile is responsible for milking the cows. Each day, the organization’s dairy cows produce around 50 liters of milk, in addition to around 300 eggs and vegetables depending on the season. The youth sell the products to five local hotels and Yeka neighbors.

“Thanks to my new job, today my life has changed radically,” he says.

He works in humane conditions and doesn’t feel like he is being exploited. He is economically independent for the first time in his life and earns around 600 birr every month. In addition, he has the opportunity to go to school, and today he is in the third grade.

”Education is the best and safest way to change our lives,” he says.

In September 2009, thanks to his personal success, he brought his sister from his hometown of Debrezague. After a childhood and adolescence similar to her brother’s, she is now 19 years old in the eighth grade.

Although every month food and school fees for him and his sister demand more than half of hissalary, Kafile is happy because he believes the most important expenses are covered. “We need to encourage all the people, especially the youth, to work hard,” he says.

<h2>A Small Beginning</h2>

<h3>Success Story: Henok Felate</h3>

Henok Felate was once a young man on the verge of desperation, choked with overwhelming feelings of having nothing: no job, no future, no hope. A widowed mother rearing eight children without permanent income found it impossible to support him past high school.

After he graduated from high school, not knowing exactly what to do,<link rel="stylesheet" href="stories.css">  he embraced the opportunity to be part of an association that collects household wastes to be processed into compost to later be used as fertilizer for vegetable gardens. His life changed

. This program is sponsored by Mary Joy Development Association and is aimed at local youths living in his neighborhood. Henok has been armed with the skills for the job, and after a small beginning, the association has become a large firm.

Being a member of the association enables him to live his dream. Even with all the challenges that life threw his way, the strength and resolve Henok acquired over the years has opened doors full of incredible opportunities. He is now a university graduate and the head of the association.

That small gesture –a small association formed by a few desperate youths– may not seem like a lot to most people, but even small things can perform miracles. The association was a vehicle that sent him like a rocket toward a productive life. Today he makes a good living and contributes back to his community.

In a country where people have so little, a small beginning can provide a hand up and make an immediate impact on many lives. As with Henok, a small beginning can change the course of one man’s destiny, and it can also save a life.




<h2>Water in the Desert</h2>

<h3>Success Story of Mesay Aragie</h3>
“The youth should fight this illness and become heroes in their own lives” Ethiopia’s younger generation faces many obstacles when trying to obtain a higher education. Mesay Aragie is an example of how these difficulties force people to continue working in impoverished conditions. Mesay couldn’t pass the 12th grade exam and was forced to stay home with his poor family.

Mesay lost his father when he was just 12 years old and his mother struggled to support all four of his brothers without a steady income. When he was denied access to the university, the situation worsened as he spent his energetic young adult life at home wondering why he couldn’t continue his education.

Then he came upon an oasis in the desert. Mesay joined Mary Joy Development Association in hopes of participating in one of Mary Joy’s environmental-focused programs.

“It was like finding water in the middle of the desert,” he said. “Joining Mary Joy was my turning point, and introduced me to the idea of protecting our environment from pollution and other man made disturbances.”

Soon Mary Joy provided Mesay with life skills, leadership abilities, environmental knowledge as well as materials, and Mesay founded the NIB Environmental Protection Youth Association, which aims to teach adolescents the importance of conservation and protecting the outside world.

As director and founder of the association, it has been challenging for him to convince other youths and governmental bodies to collaborate with NIB, supporting with material and non-material resources.

Mesay Aragie’s life has changed since creating NIB. Mesay is now a university graduate and has become self-sufficient for himself and has helped members of NIB become self-sufficient as well.

“The biggest illness is hopelessness; most youth are at their home doing nothing for themselves or for their country. The youth should fight this illness and become heroes in their own lives,” according to Mesay. </p>

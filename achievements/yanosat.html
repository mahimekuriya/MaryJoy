    <h1 style="margin-top:30px;color:#001A4D"><b>Leaving the Street Life Behind : Demekech Dejene’s Success Story</b></h1>

    <p>“When I was 14 I lost my parents due to reasons that I don’t know. <link rel="stylesheet" href="stories.css">My six brothers, my sister and I were left home alone. Fear and hopelessness took over, and we had nothing to do except look at our neighbors and wait for them to do something for us.”

    Demekech Dejene, 15 years old, grew up in the city of Hawassa in Southern Ethiopia. Demekech dropped out of school when her mother was sick. He education had taken only as far as the second grade.

    She always wanted to be a doctor, however, as the oldest of her siblings, she quickly found herself shouldering the responsibility of taking care of her brothers and her sister. After the death of her parents, she and her brothers moved in with extended family and even more children.

    Life in her aunt’s house neither comfortable nor peaceful, because her aunt couldn’t afford to take care of the extra children. As time went on, Demekech and her aunt began fighting. Finally, her aunt kicked her out, and Demekech joined life on the street.

    Street life was not as easy for Demekech as she expected. On the streets, she begged for food, smoked thrown-away cigarette butts and slept wherever she could.
    At one point, Demekech was raped by a group of other street children and she became pregnant. When she was about to have the baby, she panicked. She hoped somebody would take care of her. Fortunately one of her mother’s friends found her and gave her shelter. Assefa Demekech had a baby girl, but still lacked everything that was essential for human life.

    One day she received a visit from a community social worker and her life changed. One of her neighbors had reported her to a Mary Joy Development Association representative, and she joined the project supporting sexually victimized children, which is funded by the international NGO Save the Children.

    Mary Joy helped her by providing her with medical, nutritional and psychosocial support.

    “Street life is the worst scenario of the human experience. It is horrible and full of misery. Mary Joy really helped me get off the street to never return,” she says.
    After a few months Demekech learned to cope with her stress and requested seed money to start her own business. Accordingly, the project supported her, and now she has a small business to earn a living wage. Demekech buys vegetables and other items from suppliers and resells them in her village. She earns enough to take care of her daughter, pay rent and lead a new life.

    She never stopped thinking about the situation of her brothers and sister. Thanks to her, Mary Joy visited the home where her siblings live and observed many problems. Mary Joy, through its referral linkage network program, has referred the children to the World Food Program (WFP) and they now receive support.

    Demekech’s life changed. She developed hope, and from her small business, from which she obtains the basic needs for her daughter, she knows she can be an independent woman. Due to her experiences on the street, she wants to help children on the street by advising them to rejoin their families under whatever circumstances.
    The Pursuit of Happiness

    “Yesterday, when I woke up, no one said to me ‘Good morning’. Instead, I took to the streets to beg for money in order to feed my children.”


    Today I wake up, drink coffee with the neighbors and go to my job that pays for my children’s schooling. Thanks to Mary Joy, now everybody calls me ‘Shumet’ and hugs me with love and respect.”


    Shumet was born in a small village called Shegedo, on the outskirts of Dilla, south of Addis Ababa. There she grew up until her father died and migrated to Dilla where she and her mother lived in a relative’s house.


    At just 9-years old and in the second grade, she was abducted and forced to marry an older man. In Ethiopia, abduction marriage is a desperate option for those who have nothing. As a result, she was forced to drop out of school and moved to a nearby village called Wogela with her husband. She had three children by him.


    Together, they tried to take control of their lives but were unsuccessful. They decided to move back to Dilla in order to search for jobs and a better life.
    Life in Dilla became more and more difficult as time passed. Her husband started gambling and took to a life of crime. Due to this and the complexities of being poor, Shumet and her husband divorced, leaving her with the three children. She had no place to raise her children and with no other alternatives, she turned to begging.


    At a low point in Shumet’s life, Mary Joy appeared and registered her children Dinkitu, Zemachu, and Meseret in its orphan and vulnerable child (OVC) support program, which partners with Pact-Ethiopia in collaboration with USAID. Thereafter, Mary Joy incorporated Shumet into its income generation program.


    Accordingly, Mary Joy provided her with small scale business development management, entrepreneurship (SBDME) training and a start-up capital of 1466 birr ($95 USD).


    From this moment her life changed and she stopped begging. Since then, she has started her own coffee business that serves daily laborers. In the evening, she sells local drinks to villagers out of her home, which she rents. Her business is progressing and turning profits. Today, she makes 7 birr from one bottle of local drink and 0.50 birr from every cup of coffee sold. Shumet can earn a monthly income of 585 birr.


    In addition, Mary Joy lobbies the local school for scholarship opportunities for Shumet’s children. As a result, they now have the opportunity to attend school, receive school materials, and get an education, something their mother was not allowed.


    Thanks to her small business income, today Shumet proudly sends her children to school.


    “I have been searching for my happiness, I think today is the beginning,” she says.


    While yesterday is history, and tomorrow a mystery, Shumet is thankful for the present because her current life is better than ever before.</p>
